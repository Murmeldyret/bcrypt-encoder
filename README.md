# bcrypt-encoder

I made this program because I needed some way of generating Bcrypt hashes. And since I don't really like scripting languages then I choose to do it in Rust.
The specific reason to make this program is because [Text Pieces](https://github.com/liferooter/textpieces) does not support it and that is what I use. (Thanks for such an amazing tool by the Text Pieces developers BTW)

This program is not pretty at all, it was made so that I didn't have to use languages such as Python or JavaScript. (Did I mention that I don't like them)

If you are a job recruiter then don't read this README ;)
